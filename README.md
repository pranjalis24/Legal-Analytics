### Legal Analytics
 
#### No-Code and Low-Code Machine Learning Platforms
* No-code and low-code ML platforms allow users to build machine learning models without extensive coding knowledge. 
* These platforms speed up development and reduce costs but may lack advanced customization and security features

#### Adversarial Machine Learning
* Adversarial machine learning explores techniques to fool ML models through malicious inputs. White-box attacks exploit full knowledge of the model, while black-box attacks operate without such knowledge. 
* This research highlights the need for robust defenses, especially in applications like security, autonomous driving, and medical diagnostics, where accuracy and reliability are critical. 

#### Machine Learning Explainability
* Machine learning explainability is essential for understanding model decisions, particularly in critical areas like finance and healthcare. The paper discusses local and global explainability, focusing on Shapley values to interpret model outputs.
